# TomeOfIllusionsCheck

A World of Warcraft addon that detects whether or not you have already learned
a specific Tome of Illusions.

## What does it do?

TomeOfIllusionsCheck hooks into item tooltips, and if you mouseover a Tome of
Illusions, then it will report at the bottom of the tooltip whether or not
you have already learned it.

## How do I use it?

For example, if you have not yet learned the 'Tome of Illusions - Northrend'
and you mouseover it in the Auction House, then the bottom of the tooltip
will say "Have not learned this tome". However, if you have already learned it,
then the tooltip will say "Already learned this tome".

## I created this addon because:

* The game is not obvious about whether or not I have already learned the tomes,
and I'm tired of searching in the Wardrobe to determine which ones I have.
